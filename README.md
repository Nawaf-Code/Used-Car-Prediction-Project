## Overview
##### The aim of this project is to address the exploitation of potential buyers in the used car market who lack knowledge about the true value of a vehicle. Exploiters deceive buyers into believing that the car has a higher value than it actually does, leading to unfair transactions. This issue, an artificial intelligence program will be developed to accurately predict the price of a used vehicle based on its specifications and characteristics. By creating a more trustworthy and credible environment in the Saudi car market, this program will help buyers make informed decisions and prevent them from being exploited.
